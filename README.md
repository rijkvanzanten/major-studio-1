## Major Studio 1

**Tell me about your undergrad degree**  
I have a Bachelor of Science in Communication and Multimedia Design with a focus on Digital Product Design and a specialization in Front-End Development from the Amsterdam University of Applied Science.

**Tell me about any work experiences you have had**  
I've worked in a digital agency as front-end developer for 1.5 years and have been working as a "Creative Technologist" (ie developer) on a [Headless CMS](https://github.com/directus/app) for the past year or so.

**What do you imaging you will do in 5 years?**  
Between this government, immigration policies, and life in general, I like not to make plans, as I've experienced that things never go the way I planned/ I thought them to go.

**What do you imagine you will do when you graduate?**  
Pay off my student loans, and _live happily ever after_.

**What kind of company would you like to work at when you graduate?**  
Whatever is fun and allows me to be a better me

**What would you like to get out of this class?**  
Knowledge and/or experience. (That answer is cheating, I know)

**What made you want to be a product designer?**  
The world is full of ugly and unusable things; I'd like to add to that pile.

**Is there anything else that would be helpful for me to know?**  
I prefer the interaction design and development side of things. (vs visual interface design and user research)
